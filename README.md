[TODO: here would be project description]

### How to install

[TODO: tell user where he should get keys, where they should be and how they look like]
Create .env file with following consts

```
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
SECRET_KEY=REPLACE_ME
DEBUG=True
```

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
